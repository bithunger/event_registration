**Event Registration:**

- Registered users should be able to register for an event.

- Limit the number of available slots for each event.

**User Registration:**

Implement user registration functionality to allow users to create accounts.

**User Authentication:**

- Ensure that only authenticated users can register for events.

- Users should only be able to unregister from events they've registered for.

**Admin Panel:**

- Utilize Django's admin panel for managing events and user registrations.

**Search Functionality:**

- Implement a basic search functionality that allows users to search for events based on keywords.

**Dashboard for Users:**

Design and implement API endpoints for:
